    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Rum Ham originated in Season 7 Episode 2, The Gang Goes to the Jersey Shore.
      Frank brought the ham so that he could get drunk while eating on the beach,
      leading to a Cast Away-esque series of events.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ham appears to be a normal ham soaked in rum, as well as
      having two pineapple rings for eyes and a red cherry for a nose,
      again continuing the 'Wilson' in Cast Away themes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The ham has reappeared in multiple episodes, such as Season 10 Episode 6,
      The Gang Misses the Boat, and Season 11 Episode 2, Frank Falls Out the Window.
      The ham also appeared in the game, Itâ€™s Always Sunny: Gang Goes Mobile as apart
      of the Mancheetah Frank and Rum Ham Frank cards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The ham has gained a significant cult following, with multiple people recreating the
      famed ham on cooking websites, as well as fanfiction pieces of art being drawn of the ham.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 10-pound canned ham</li>
      <li>1 hunting knife</li>
      <li>3 1-liter bottles of rum</li>
      <li>1 handgun</li>
      <li>1 box handgun ammo</li>
      <li>1 bunch of Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>De-can ham (for instructions, see back of can).</li>
      <li>Using the hunting knife, carve a hole in the top of the ham wide enough to hold the mouth of a rum bottle.</li>
      <li>Open first rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole. If you made your hole deep enough, it should stand up there on it's own.</li>
      <li>Load gun.</li>
      <li>Open second rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole (the one in your face this time). As the liquid flows into your mouth, swallow at regular intervals.</li>
      <li>Repeat step five until bottle is empty.</li>
      <li>Open third bottle of rum and repeat step six.</li>
      <li>Remove safety from handgun.</li>
      <li>Wait for ham pirates.</li>
      <li>Shoot ham pirates.</li>
      <li>Reload gun.</li>
      <li>Repeat steps eight through eleven until rum has been fully absorbed into ham, usually about twelve hours.</li>
      <li>Garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
