    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fight Milk was a drink created by Charlie in an effort to save Atwater Capital.
       Charlie believed the company needed a new product, and that the growing crow population in the city could be exploited.
       Hence, he worked with Mac to create "the first alcoholic, dairy-based protein drink for bodyguards by bodyguards."
       Charlie and Mac presented a promotion of the drink to Atwater Capital's investors, to no avail.</p>
